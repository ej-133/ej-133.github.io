    <h1> Let's Talk About Poet-X !!!</h1>

    <h3> Summary of Poet-X </h3>

    <p>
        The Adult Novel Poet-X is written in a poetic form, 
        having every chapter being in the form of a poem about how the main character Xiomara Batista lives in the heart of 
        Harlem, New York one of the most cultural and important places in New York. Xiomara a Latina woman at the age of 
        fifteen starts to explore her identity and sexuality which diverges from her Mother’s teaching of Christianity and 
        how to gain acceptance in heaven relying on women’s purity. However, when Xiomara gains the attention from a love-interest 
        such as Xavier a guy near the same age going to the same school. Her ideas of staying pure as her mother wants her to be
        she starts to question, and the only way of analyzing these questions was through the poems that she would write. 

    This Adult Novel is more based upon the author Elizabeth Acevedo experience so it has a lot of personal connections that the author has 
    talked about. Which is a clear understanding of what it means to be a Latina/x women in America.

    <h3> My recomendation for Poet-X </h3>
 
        <h3>9.5/10</h3>   
    <p>
        This is a great read and I enjoyed the in the poeitc form that it was 
        written in. This also made it a bit of quick read, but included aspects of understanding
        women's purity in a Christian sense.  
        I think the only thing that stops from a full on 10 was the aspect
        about the ending being to cute and cuddly. If there was a little more 
        of an suspenseful ending then I would have enjoyed the book a lot more.
        Or if it even did a small dip into the brother's arc of story, becuase 
        his love interest proposed that it might be towards another man. That 
        would have gave me a little bit of the drama that I was seeking within the book.
