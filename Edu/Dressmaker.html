    <h1>The Princess and Dressmaker</h1>
    <h3> Summary of Dressmaker </h3>
    <p>
        This Graphic Novel takes the shape and form of fantasy times emphasizing Prince and Princess, 
        allowing the story to examine gender roles in a different type of environment. 
        It takes place with the seamstress Frances being hired for a particular job of making clothes for the prince. 
        However, the prince requested dresses that would fit a princess for him to wear, and with this, the prince was 
        able to take another persona that he would wear on occasion to feel more like himself. The prince was able to 
        adopt the name Lady Crystalia who was able to gain recognition by being Lady Crystalia which Prince Sebastion enjoyed. 

        This book additionally follows the author's personal story with them not identifying with one gender or the other. 
        Which was able to give a perspective of what it can be like for people wanting to identify in unique ways.
