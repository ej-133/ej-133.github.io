    <h3> My recomendation for More Happy than Not </h3>
    <h3>7.5/10</h3>   
    <p>
        This book was a good read. There was a lot of traumatic experiences
         and that were throughout reading. 
         A lot of trigger warnings that might be good to address people before reading.
         Especailly depending on the young adults that might be reading this, and 
         need guidance with how to cope with the ending of the book. However, it was a solid read, 
         and I enjoyed it, just would watch the warnings for recommending for others, 
         especailly for a lower age group.
