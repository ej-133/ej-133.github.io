    <h1>The Princess and Dressmaker</h1>
    <h3> Summary of Stamped </h3>
    <p>

        This book covers the story of African American presence within the United States, 
        told as a literature book which makes it seem like a Young Adult novel. 
        This story is a simple novel that makes it easier for younger children to read, explaining the history of 
        African-American culture without intimidating a younger audience. This book goes through terms and different 
        aspects that people might become normative to, but have racist connotations behind the terms or examples. 

        For this reason, some people can call it a history book, however, the authors Ibram X. 
        Kendi and Jason Reynolds would rather not until someone reads it.
