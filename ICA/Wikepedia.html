            The show centers around the adventures and activities of the dysfunctional Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, 
            a bumbling and clumsy yet well-intentioned blue-collar 
            worker; his wife Lois, a stay-at-home mother and piano 
            teacher (in early episodes) who is a member of the affluent 
            Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often bullied teenage 
            daughter who is constantly ridiculed or ignored by the 
            family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent, 
            unathletic and, in many respects, simply a younger version of his 
            father, and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual 
            orientation who is an adult-mannered evil genius and uses 
            stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their 
            witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking 
            anthropomorphic dog Brian, although he is still considered a pet in
            many ways.[8]

            Recurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. 
            These include the family's neighbors: sex-crazed airline 
            pilot bachelor Glenn Quagmire; deli owner/mail carrier 
            Cleveland Brown and his wife Loretta (later Donna); 
            paraplegic police officer Joe Swanson, his wife Bonnie, 
            their son Kevin and their baby daughter Susie; neurotic 
            Jewish pharmacist Mort Goldman, his wife Muriel, and their
            geeky and annoying son Neil, and elderly child molester
            Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, 
            Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, and Blaccu-Weather 
            meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent 
            appearances. Actor James Woods guest stars as himself in 
            multiple episodes, as did Adam West, prior to his death.

            MacFarlane conceived Family Guy in 1995 while studying 
            animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).[32] 
            During college, he created his thesis film entitled The 
            Life of Larry,[32] which was submitted by his professor at
            RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company.
            [33] In 1996, MacFarlane created a sequel to The Life of
            Larry entitled Larry and Steve, which featured a 
            middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog,
            Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon
            Network's World Premiere Toons.[32]
            Executives at Fox saw the Larry shorts and contracted 
            MacFarlane to create a series, entitled Family Guy, 
            based on the characters.[10] Fox proposed that MacFarlane 
            complete a 15-minute short and gave him a budget of $50,000.
            [34] Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the 
            Larry shorts.[35] While MacFarlane worked on the series, 
            the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved 
            into Peter and Brian.[10][36] MacFarlane stated that the 
            difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that 
            "Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and 
            Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl."[35] After the
            pilot aired, the series was given the green light. 
            MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as 
            The Simpsons and All in the Family.[37] Premises were drawn
            from several 1980s Saturday-morning cartoons he watched as
            a child, such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and 
            Rubik, the Amazing Cube.[38]  
            The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that 
            MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.[39] Family Guy 
            was originally planned to start out as short movies for the 
            sketch show Mad TV, but the plan changed, because MADtv's 
            budget was not large enough to support animation production.
            MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as
            he thought that it was the place to create a prime-time 
            animation show.[37] Family Guy was originally pitched to 
            Fox in the same year as King of the Hill, but the show was
            not bought until years later, when King of the Hill became 
            successful.[37] Fox ordered 13 episodes of Family Guy to 
            air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with 
            a 14-minute pilot.[40][41]

            Family Guy uses the film-making technique of cutaways, 
            which occur in the majority of Family Guy episodes.[126] 
            Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to 
            social phenomena and/or modern cultural icons.
            Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's 
            "super villain" antics, such as his constant plans for 
            total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and 
            inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his 
            constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, 
            the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and 
            the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began 
            writing him with a different personality.[127] Family Guy 
            often includes self-referential humor. 
            
            The most common 
            form is jokes about the Fox network, and occasions where 
            the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the 
            audience. For example, in "North by North Quahog", the 
            first episode that aired after the show's revival, 
            included Peter telling the family that they had been
            canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for
            shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, 
            That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter 
            Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, 
            The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, FreakyLinks, Wanda at Large, 
            Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, 
            Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, 
            The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer 
            Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks 
            whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if 
            all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; 
            the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guy's hiatus.
            [128][129]
        
       
            The show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and 
            secondary characters have them. Notable expressions 
            include Quagmire's "Giggity giggity goo", Peter's 
            "Freakin' sweet", Cleveland's "Oh, that's nasty", and 
            Joe's "Bring it on!"[127] The use of many of these 
            catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode 
            "Big Man on Hippocampus" mocks catchphrase-based humor: 
            when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, 
            is introduced to Meg, he exclaims "D'oh!", to which Lois 
            replies, "No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase."
